loving of enemies is another dogma of feigned morality and has besides no meaning it is incumbent on man as a moralist that he does not revenge an injury and it is equally as good in a political sense for there is no end to retaliation each retaliates on the other and calls it justice but to love in proportion to the injury if it could be done would be to offer a premium for a crime besides the word enemies is too vague and general to be used in a moral maxim which ought always to be clear and defined like a proverb if a man be the enemy of another from mistake and prejudice as in the case of religious opinions and sometimes in politics that man is different to an enemy at heart with a criminal intention and it is incumbent upon us and it contributes also to our own tranquillity that we put the best construction upon a thing that it will bear but even this erroneous motive in him makes no motive for love on the other part and to say that we can love voluntarily and without a motive is morally and physically impossiblemorality is injured by prescribing to it duties that in the first place are impossible to be performed and if they could be would be productive of evil or as before said be premiums for crime the maxim of doing as we would be done unto does not include this strange doctrine of loving enemies for no man expects to be loved himself for his crime or for his enmitythose who preach this doctrine of loving their enemies are in general the greatest persecutors and they act consistently by so doing for the doctrine is hypocritical and it is natural that hypocrisy should act the reverse of what it preaches for my own part i disown the doctrine and consider it as a feigned or fabulous morality yet the man does not exist that can say i have persecuted him or any man or any set of men either in the american revolution or in the french revolution or that i have in any case returned evil for evil,love

some quotes from standing starkthe mind is the charioteer of experience while the body is the vehicle that carries out the orders of its driver the gift we have been given is the one called possibility whose intent offers to tie all together creating strands of a whole life rather than a disintegrated oneit is our own microcosmic journey that gives life meaning and weaves us into the macrocosm of existence life does begin with each of us it then expands outward to touch others with how we liveat some time in our lives we receive a signal to arouse from a deep sleep if we answer the cue we set out on a journey toward authenticity that takes us into the unknown we begin to separate from the selves we thought we were and search for who we areset your intent and let it go your intent is your beginning worrying about the details detracts from the intent in your strong intent the attraction will take care of the detailsthe conscious realization i offer now is that when we learn to trust we will be led to all we ever need our only job is to be awake and follow the leadwe can gauge the measure of truth in our lives by the lightness of our body emotions and energy we need only be aware in any given moment of the state of our being and be guided this is what we are asked to do on the spiritual path we arent headed for a continuing chaotic free fall but an order of divine natureafter all if were on the spiritual path we can trust that there is much we dont know these mysteries are hidden from us until we are ripe the paradox is that we frantically attempt to know in order to surrender to the place of not knowing the other paradox is that there are no mysteries because the cues are surrounding us all the time were just too tied up to recognize themthere comes a time when we are knowingly left with the ramifications of the choices we make while it would be comforting to think that the progressions we undertake will be painless and smooth any change involves conflict between what was and what will be therein lies the opportunity for learning and alignment to an authentic lifewords are the shell they feed intellectual knowledge what lies in the middle of words is the seed that if presented and embraced in a certain way will take us to the place we seek,inspirational

the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great treei believe this simile largely speaks the truth the green and budding twigs may represent existing species and those produced during former years may represent the long succession of extinct species at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches in the same manner as species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life the limbs divided into great branches and these into lesser and lesser branches were themselves once when the tree was young budding twigs and this connection of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush only two or three now grown into great branches yet survive and bear the other branches so with the species which lived during longpast geological periods very few have left living and modified descendants from the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living representatives and which are known to us only in a fossil state as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit so we occasionally see an animal like the ornithorhynchus or lepidosiren which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station as buds give rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation i believe it has been with the great tree of life which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth and covers the surface with its everbranching and beautiful ramifications,life
