if we are inclined to forget how much there is in the world besides that which we anticipate then works of art are perhaps a little to blame for in them we find at work the same process of simplification or selection as in the imagination artistic accounts include severe abbreviations of what reality will force upon us a travel book may tell us for example that the narrator journeyed through the afternoon to reach the hill town of x and after a night in its medieval monastery awoke to a misty dawn but we never simply journey through an afternoon we sit in a train lunch digests awkwardly within us the seat cloth is grey we look out the window at a field we look back inside a drum of anxieties resolves in our consciousness we notice a luggage label affixed to a suitcase in a rack above the seats opposite we tap a finger on the window ledge a broken nail on an index finger catches a thread it starts to rain a drop wends a muddy path down the dustcoated window we wonder where our ticket might be we look back at the field it continues to rain at last the train starts to move it passes an iron bridge after which it inexplicably stops a fly lands on the window and still we may have reached the end only of the first minute of a comprehensive account of the events lurking within the deceptive sentence he journeyed through the afternoona storyteller who provides us with such a profusion of details would rapidly grow maddening unfortunately life itself often subscribes to this mode of storytelling wearking us out with repetitions misleading emphases and inconsequential plot lines it insists on showing us burdak electronics the safety handle in the car a stray dog a christmas card and a fly that lands first on the rim and then the centre of a laden ashtraywhich explains the curious phenomenon whereby valuable elements may be easier to experience in art and in anticipation than in reality the anticipatory and artistic imaginations omit and compress they cut away the periods of boredom and direct our attention to critical moments and thus without either lying or embellishing they lend to life a vividness and a coherence that it may lack in the distracting woolliness of the present,philosophy
